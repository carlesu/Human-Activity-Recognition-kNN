# Abstract
This paper presents an offline method for classifying locomotion type human activities into 6 separate groups: underground subway, train, walking, running, climbing stairs and the additional position of sitting down.
The data is gathered with the accelerometers that are embedded into current smartphones, having the device placed into the subject's pocket.
Data is treated to obtain meaningful features in order to impact the discrimination ability of a k-nearest neighbours clustering algorithm which is applied to classify the motion.
At the end of the report, results and conclusions are presented.
